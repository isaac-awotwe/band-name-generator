## Band Name Generator App

Suppose a friend was starting a new band (e.g. a rock band or a classical band) and they're struggling to come up with a good name.
The band name generator program to the rescue!

The band name generator is a simple application that asks a user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.
The app then combines the city and pet names together as a suggestion of the name of the band.

The app uses Python skills like:
- printing to the console
- commenting
- the input function
- python variables
- string manipulation
- debuggiing, etc.
- streamlit
